<h2 style="color: #67a1c4">Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to
create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.</h2>

### Your application should do the following::
<ul>
<li>
Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database

<li>
The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Student can enroll in the following courses:
